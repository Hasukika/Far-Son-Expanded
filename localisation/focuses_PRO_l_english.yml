  wyoming_mole_left_opener:0 "Buried Wyoming"
  wyoming_mole_left_opener_desc:0 "Wyoming was scarred by the war like everywhere else, but where others saw devastation and junk, the Mole Miners saw opportunity and loot."
  
  wyoming_mole_2:0 "Scrap Trading"
  wyoming_mole_2_desc:0 "For some reason Mole Miners loved their trading, anything shiny was hoarded and everyone tried to amass the biggest stash. Obviously nobody could compete with Morghorl, but it hardly was a deterrent."
  
  wyoming_mole_3:0 "Mining Economy"
  wyoming_mole_3_desc:0 "Not just shiny stuff was traded, but a whole economy developed around getting valuables out of the mines and exchanging them for some strange 'sript' that Morghorl had got his hands on and introduced as a currency."
  
  wyoming_mole_manpower:0 "Undig Our Brothers"
  wyoming_mole_manpower_desc:0 "When the big rumbling unearthed the Mole Miners and started their rampage across Wyoming, plenty of other Miners were still trapped underground, they would need outside help to get rescued from their predicament"
  
  wyoming_mole_manpower_dos:0 "Morghorl's Palace"
  wyoming_mole_manpower_dos_desc:0 "Morghorl always wanted a big cave just for himself. He'd keep telling the Miners to dig, dig and dig more until they eventually created a massive underground lair filled with treasure, luxury and all kind furniture."
  
  wyoming_mole_water:0 "Water Pumping"
  wyoming_mole_water_desc:0 "The mineshafts the Miners used often flooded, before the war they had a lot of pumps set up to help with that, although they were long broken now. Still, the Miners figured they could repair them and even use the water for their own purposes. Not like the little radiation bothered them."
  
  wyoming_mole_factory_1:0 "Boss's Big Plan"
  wyoming_mole_factory_1_desc:0 "The Boss always made plans, it was kind of his job. Well, maybe they weren't always the best or practical plans, but they definetly were always ambitious. Now the Boss had decided to make a new plan, his biggest one yet. And to make it reality he'd need a lot of preparing."
  
  wyoming_mole_plant:0 "The Big Dig"
  wyoming_mole_plant_desc:0 "The biggest challenge the Mole Miners faced was that of logistics. Their mineshafts ran deep, but were not connected. This forced the Miners to leave their tunnels and walk across the dangerous surface whenever they wanted to move around. The Boss decided that a massive project should be undertaken that would interlink all the little and big mines of Wyoming."
  
  wyoming_mole_escape:0 "Surface Scavenging"
  wyoming_mole_escape_desc:0 "The Moles found a lot of useful stuff underground, but the supplies were still limited and so their greed took them above ground for scavenging."
  
  wyoming_mole_power:0 "Fix Up Old Industry"
  wyoming_mole_power_desc:0 "Some of the old facilities and factories were still somewhat usable for the Miner's purposes. So they decided to man the machines and make them run again."
  
  wyoming_mole_tools:0 "Better Tools, Better Guns"
  wyoming_mole_tools_desc:0 "A pickaxe was nice and all, but the Miners prefered something more practical and modern. Same with guns really. So there was always quite a struggle about who could get the best equipment. Naturally the higher of a standing a Miner had the better he'd be equipped."
  
  wyoming_mole_comp:0 "Above Ground Reclamaiton"
  wyoming_mole_comp_desc:0 "With the Moles mobilised they made their great above ground surge. Sure, underground was better, but removing all the pests that plauged the surface was important to the Boss."
  
  wyoming_mole_research:0 "Underground Empire"
  wyoming_mole_research_desc:0 "The surface cleaned and the tunnels connected, the Boss was happy with Wyoming. A true land of Miners and mutation, where the hills were hollow and the ground full of riches. Here, nobody dared to mess with Morghorl."
  
  pro_stormchasing:0 "Wyoming, Dominated"
  pro_stormchasing_desc:0 "The Miners didn't take long to move in. How could anyone stop them? The Watch that had so heroically assembled had fallen, despite their best efforts to stem the moletide. Now, the Boss was in charge, yet that wasn't even the worst part. The worst part was that he was dissatisfied."
  
  pro_appease_wind_spirits:0 "Choppin' Wood"
  pro_appease_wind_spirits_desc:0 "Lonetree was a perfect choice for the Boss. It would secure a wider berth around the South Pass and Far Son, allowing a longer front to be maintained against the surface dwellers."
  
  pro_storms_fury:0 "A Treasure Trove"
  pro_storms_fury_desc:0 "To the north the Boss turned himself then, towards the home of some 'Baron'. Hungry for their wealth and craving violence, he whipped the miners into a frenzy and lead the way into northern Wyoming."
  
  pro_abandoned_airfields:0 "Bunkering Down"
  pro_abandoned_airfields_desc:0 "With all their new conquest the moles found their old tunnels undermanned and badly maintained. The Boss told them to fix up the supports, make some repairs on the vents and build a ton of defensive positions so any invader wouldn't stand a chance. The moles quietly obeyed."
  
  pro_rewire_radio_towers:0 "Hunting Humans"
  pro_rewire_radio_towers_desc:0 "The moles were slow, loud, and not very quick on the draw, but the humans still feared them more than any raider gang or supermutant. Since they were used to operating in complete darkness the Miners usually hunted at night, and no human was safe from them at hunting hour."
  
  pro_secret_stash_air_force:0 "Atomic Mining Techniques"
  pro_secret_stash_air_force_desc:0 "The Mole Miners do not celebrate their successes but Boss Morghorl could not help but spend the day barking happily after inspecting the newest pile of loot dragged before him. In the center of the heap, buried under an old chryslus was a crate of untouched mini nukes."
  
  pro_rewire_radio_towers_2:0 "Even More Boom"
  pro_rewire_radio_towers_2_desc:0 "The Miners liked Alton Bourges' toys, but sadly those were limited in number so there was always a big need for scavenging anything they could get their hands on. Luckily the Boss, in his infinite cunning, managed to figure out how to break into an old military base and snatch some blueprints from there. With these documents he could get the Miners some really deadly firepower."
  
  pro_ancestral_knowledge:0 "Rockblasting"
  pro_ancestral_knowledge_desc:0 "With their new tools the Miners mobilised and armed themselves to the teeth, especially Morghorl was eager to get more loot in his grabbers."
  
  pro_kid_namer:0 "Morghorl's Secret Stash"
  pro_kid_namer_desc:0 "With all the loot Morghorl's coffins were bursting, his treasure chamber could hardly hold any more. Even worse, he grew paranoid about others trying to steal his hard earned stuff. So Morghorl made the decision to hide most of his valuables and stuff them where nobody could find."
  
  pro_finger_finisher:0 "Burning The Brutes"
  pro_finger_finisher_desc:0 "With their tunnels and lairs teeming and the boss hungry for more minerals and territory, it was no surprise when the first mole miners began to trespass into the lands once known as Colorado. With Morghorls hungry eyes upon their wealth, those great rocky mountains will be the next to fall."
  
  pro_the_southern_run_2:0 "Mean Miners Mines"
  pro_the_southern_run_2_desc:0 "The Boss was enraged to learn of the legendary 'Deepmines,' and swore an oath that it would be in Mole Miner hands in no time. How could they be Mole Miners, and not have the deepest mine? He set out to correct this fact as soon as possible."
  
  pro_the_wyoming_heirs_2:0 "What's Deep Is Now, Uh, Mine"
  pro_the_wyoming_heirs_2_desc:0 "The Deepmines were where they belonged: under Mole Miner control. Now, the Boss could live with relative peace knowing his mine was the deepest in all the land."
  
  pro_down_with_darkness_2:0 "Showing Em' Real Darkness"
  pro_down_with_darkness_2_desc:0 "The Boss set his sights on another foe: Battery of Mesa Verde and the men and women of the Black Canyon. Their land was too vast and their influence too great on the western mountains. They had to go, lest the Boss go mad from rage."
  
  pro_the_wyoming_heirs_160:0 "Mystery Of The Mountains"
  pro_the_wyoming_heirs_160_desc:0 "The Miners had heard rumors about some mysterious entrances in the mountains, some old metal doors and vaults in hollow caves. Something the Boss didn't know what to do with, but after a ton of strange folk turned up near the origin of the rumors, the Miners had to take action and investigate."
  
  pro_lightning_carriers:0 "Looting The Barons' Stuff"
  pro_lightning_carriers:0 "With the humans having been overrun by surperior Mole Miner forces, the Baron's lands were ripe for looting and plundering. The few survivors dragged underground and their homes burned to the ground, a great joy for all Miners involved."
  
  pro_gods_hammer:0 "Picking A Bone"
  pro_gods_hammer_desc:0 "The Dry Bones meant nothing to the Boss. He was more interested in the strange, misshapen creatures that emerged from Burham Springs: the Gehenna and the Molech. Though he didn't understand them, he sought to control them as any tyrant would. First, however, he would have to secure their land..."
  
  pro_gods_butchers:0 "Horrid Yet Useful"
  pro_gods_butchers_desc:0 "The wretched creatures from Burham Springs were resistant for a time, but soon the Miners figured out how to weaponize them just as others had, and so the dark armies of Far Son grew in even more horrible ways..."
  
  pro_thunder_struck:0 "Nasty Flowers"
  pro_thunder_struck_desc:0 "Burkham Springs didn't only hold mutated fauna, but also horrid flora. Vines and carnivorous plants grew in the less volcanic parts of the caverns."
  
  pro_divine_assistance:0 "The, Erm, Other Miners"
  pro_divine_assistance_desc:0 "Not all Miners were affected by the bombs the same way, some turned into Mole Miners thanks to their protective suits, but others weren't quite so lucky. The ones without suits survived the intial blasts thanks to the deep mineshafts they worked in, but they then found themselves without food, water, or help. Worse, the lack of air slowly drove them mad. Eventually the hunger made them cannibalise each other and this transformed them into the terrifying monsters that can be found stalking the mines even Mole Miners keep away from."
  
  pro_bazin:0 "Ultracite Injections"
  pro_bazin_desc:0 "The Boss figured that Ultracite was tough stuff, really tough stuff, so putting some of it into their Mining Suits would turn the Miners into really tough guys. Pretty logical."
  
  wyoming_right_opener_pro:0 "Tunnel Rats"
  wyoming_right_opener_pro_desc:0 "Underground you gotta be creative to do combat, good thing the Mole Miners always knew what they were doing down in their tunnels."
  
  wyoming_army_exp_pro:0 "More Rats"
  wyoming_army_exp_pro_desc:0 "Numbers were definetly a big advantage the Mole Miners always tried to keep over their enemy, to do this they'd need to get pretty ridiculous with their sheer numbers tho."
  
  wyoming_war_support_pro:0 "Mircomanagment"
  wyoming_war_support_pro_desc:0 "Sometimes the Boss has to do things himself, like when Morghorl decided it would be best to lead his forces directly for a while because he pretty upset at his commanders."
  
  wyoming_right_assymmetry_pro:0 "Skullcrushing"
  wyoming_right_assymmetry_pro_desc:0 "The nastiest, deadliest, Mole Miners were the ones called 'Skullcrushers' their tactics were deadly and their furiosity unmatched."
  
  wyoming_training_idea_pro:0 "Digging Deeper"
  wyoming_training_idea_pro_desc:0 "The Miners liked their tunnels and were always eager to dig deeper and faster. Something they needed because the harsh above ground terrain was often unsuited for the Miners."
  
  wyoming_planning_pro:0 "Learning While Doing"
  wyoming_planning_pro_desc:0 "The Boss quickly found out he wasn't actually the best at all this logistic stuff, but not like anyone complained either. He just had to learn while at the job, no shame in that."
  
  wyoming_cute_idea_pro:0 "Playing It Safe"
  wyoming_cute_idea_pro_desc:0 "A big horde charging at the enemy is sure something the Boss always liked to see, but the Miners had to conserve their strenght and be cautious due to their limited resources and manpower. Better play it safe than die unnecessarily."
  
  wyoming_arms_fact_1_pro:0 "Producing The Blasters"
  wyoming_arms_fact_1_pro_desc:0 "The moles had to somehow figure out how to make their own stuff, make their own workshops. That way they wouldn't run out of weapons or ammunition and could keep up their impressive firepower."
  
  wyoming_arms_fact_2_pro:0 "Rebreather Manufacturing"
  wyoming_arms_fact_2_pro_desc:0 "The Alton Bourges Mining Suits the Miners used were lacking in many ways, but they were still all the mutated Miners knew. So making their own even shoddier copied versions was useful incase their own ones broke or got destroyed in battle."
  
  wyoming_homeland_idea_pro:0 "Rudimentary Planning"
  wyoming_homeland_idea_pro_desc:0 "Despite the Boss's big ambitions Mole Miners only had rudamentary intelligence, due to that their tactics were often very simple in nature. This made countering them very easy for the humans, so the mole supervisors decided to come up with some more advanced tactics for their subordinates to follow."
  
  wyoming_expansion_idea_pro:0 "Incomprehensible Networks"
  wyoming_expansion_idea_pro_desc:0 "The Miners often dug extra tunnels, well hidden from any human eye, to supply themselves even in desperate situations. That way they never ran out of bullets or food, causing great confusion among their foes."
  
  wyoming_idea_coalesce_pro:0 "Dark As A Dungeon"
  wyoming_idea_coalesce_pro_desc:0 "The Miners of Wyoming had come a long way, their weapons repaired, their suits fully functional, they would make the humans fear the dark, the caves, and all that lied below."
