Over time much of the mine has fallen out of use, old equipment breaking down and the miners shifting their attentions to the surface world. Despite the dire state of the mine it can still serve the boss well, but important decisions need to be made."

Moving some equipment we collected to the mine will allow us to clear some rubble and also extract the resources and minerals that litter the walls of the mineshafts."
